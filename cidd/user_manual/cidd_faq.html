<A name="Q1.1"> 
<B> 1.1 Fonts do not fit in the buttons. The menus and panels look
	  terrible and some elements are obscured. What is going on and,
	  most importantly, how can I fix it? </B>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><I>
   A: The XView toolkit that CIDD uses as a GUI layer has a relatively
	  ambiguous specification for its default font. It finds a
	  really big font because your X server lists big fonts first
	  when it sets up the default X font path and XView does
	  not scale the size of the widgets to fit the fonts.
	  <P> The current, preferred workaround is to add specific Openwindows font specifications
	  into your .Xresources file: 
	  <UL>
		<LI>OpenWindows.MonospaceFont: fixed
		<LI>OpenWindows.RegularFont: -b&h-lucida-medium-r-normal-sans-12-100-75-75-*-*-iso8859-1
		<LI>OpenWindows.BoldFont:  -b&h-lucida-bold-r-normal-sans-12-100-75-75-*-*-iso8859-1
	  </UL>
	  <h4>or, if lucida sans fonts are not found on your system, try:</h4>
	  <UL>
		<LI>OpenWindows.MonospaceFont: fixed
		<LI>OpenWindows.RegularFont: 6x13
		<LI>OpenWindows.BoldFont: 6x13bold
	  </UL>
	  <UL> <h4> For a Mac with minimal fonts installed try: </h4>
		<LI>OpenWindows.MonospaceFont: fixed
		<LI>OpenWindows.RegularFont:  times-medium-12
		<LI>OpenWindows.BoldFont:  times-bold-12
	  </UL>
	  <P> Merge this into your current resource set with: <B> 'xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources' </B>
	  After editing your ~/.Xresources file. 

	  <P> Another Simple work-around is to ask for a specific font on the command line;
	  <BR> <B> CIDD -font lucidasans-bold-12 -p CIDD.myparamfile </B> <BR>
	  <BR> <B> CIDD -font times-medium-12 -p CIDD.myparamfile </B> <BR>
	  <I> Note: Older versions of CIDD will honor but complain of unknown command line arguments when using the -font or any other Openwindows command line
	  options on startup. These can be safely ignored. Newer versions of CIDD do not
	  complain. </I>

<A name="Q1.2"> 
<B> 1.2 Under Mac OS 10.4 and above: CIDD's popup panels are non-functional. The Mac OS window
    manager never gives focus to the popup panels, so the user cannot select or change GUI elements. </B>

   A: Enter the following commands in a terminal window, then quit and restart X11.
   <I><P> defaults write com.apple.x11 wm_click_through -bool true </P>
   <P>defaults write com.apple.x11 wm_ffm -bool true </P></I>
   <BR> <P> Check your current settings with 'defaults read com.apple.x11'

   For the latest XQuartz server, the preference name is org.macosforge.xquartz.X11
   So enter the following commands in a terminal window, then quit and restart X11.
   <I><P> defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 wm_click_through -bool true </P>
   <P>defaults org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 wm_ffm -bool true </P></I>
   <BR>

  <h5>Dennis Flanigan (dennisf@ucar.edu) Adds: </h5>
  <p>I installed the Xquartz
  version of X windows and not the Apple version when I upgraded to
  Leopard.  I discovered that for Xquartz, the defaults are not kept
  in the com.apple.x11 preferences , but in the org.x.X11 preferences
  instead.

  <p>So Xquartz users should replace com.apple.x11 with
  org.x.X11 in the commands listed in section 1.2 of
  the CIDD FAQ.

  <p>A somewhat easier procedure is to navigate to
  ~/Library/Preferences.  From the command line
  use 'open org.x.X11.plist' or from the finder
  double click on org.x.X11.plist.   Either of these
  steps will bring up the Property List Editor.  Opening
  the Root property list will allow access to the
  wm_click_through and wm_ffm properties.

<A name="Q3.1"> 
<B> 3.1  What is the difference between the "terrain" and "landuse" fields?A </B>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><I>
<P>   A: "Terrain" must be a Mdv file/URL which contains
   elevation data. It is used primarily to obscure data above a particular
   elevation. For example, looking at the 900Mb plot over Colorado, or a
   cross section of model data, on pressure layers, over a mountain range.
   <BR>
    Note: Niles Oien has <A
   HREF="http://www.rap.ucar.edu/~oien/terrain/makeTerrain.html">
    instructions </A> on preparing these data.

<P>   Landuse, is gridded data that is rendered underneath all other
   data. Many choose to use the same URL as their terrain data and
   use a color scale to provide a false colored topological map. Many
   choose to use a colorscale that uses "ocean blue" for elevations of
   0 meters. This works pretty well, unless you are looking at coastal
   areas where your map will show "Ocean" far inland. A better approach,
   and much more pleasing to the eye is to take a geo-referenced image,
   like a geotiff and run it through <b>Image2Mdv</b> to produce an Mdv
   encapsulated geo-tiff, which CIDD and JADE know how to render. Shaded
   relief images are available from the USGS that contain a combination
   of topological features as well as land category to produce very
   pleasing maps. There are detailed notes in the Image2Mdv source code
   directory which illustrate its use.

 <P> Note: Landuse can refer to a non-static data set. For example you could
   use a WMS Server(via WMS2MdvServer), or a Mdv Server to feed it live
   data showing maps that include up-to-date- traffic, flood coverage,
   satellite imagery, etc.

<A name="Q3.2"> 
<B> 3.2 What do I have to do to render a new SPDB data type?
<BR> "The Insitu Turbulence project would like
 to render the new spdb Edr data type
 in CIDD. What do I need to do?</B>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><I>
 <P>If you are using a totally new data type, you'll need to create a Symprod
 server for this new data format. In OO terms - you need to create a vi1G
 method for your new model. This process will translate your binary format
 into lines, text and symbols (Symprod format spdb data) which CIDD renders.
 If you used a pre-existing data format you just need to place the proper
 "SPDB to Symprod Server"  in your URL's. See <A HREF="#Q2.1symprod">
  question 2.1 </a>

 <P>Check out cvs/apps/dsserver/ and look at all the different *2Symprod
 apps. Pick  one with similar data format and/or  and rendering. Copy
 that and create a Edr2Symprod server.  Once this gets built, you can then
 add a config line in CIDD's param files to load and render this product.

 <P>You'll also need to coordinate with Mike Dixon (author of DsServerMgr)
 to add a hook for your new data type into the server manager, so it
 can fire up your new Symprod server automatically.

<A name="Q4.1"> 
<B> 4.1  Data retrieval is intermittent. Products don't always appear.  When the # of movie frames gets larger,
	the client requests begin to fail.  For very short movies the requests are all
	successful and I can see all the products, then as the movie gets longer fewer
	and fewer products are successfully gotten.  </B>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><I>
   A: The likely cause of this  problem is that the <b> cidd.data_timeout_secs:
   </b> parameter is set too small. Spdb Servers can sometimes take a long
   time to do their work and respond, especially if they have a lot of
   data to process. 
   <P> In some cases it may be advantageous to set up CIDD to request
   SPDB products for each individual frame, rather than requesting data
   which covers the entire movie loop. To enable this, set the parameter;
   <b>short_requests = TRUE;</b> in the &lt;SYMPRODS&gt; section of the parameter
   file. 

   <P> Note:  The 'short requests' mode will often return data quicker, but will
   take a longer time overall to build a movie loop because products which
   appear in more than one movie frame have to be re-requested. Additionally,
   several of the time selection modes become ineffective due to the limited
   storage of product data across time.

   <P> Another possibility is that your DS_COMM_TIMEOUT_MSECS environment
   variable is set too small. The default value is 30,000. (30 sec). 30
   seconds is high enough for most access across the Internet. Unless you
   have reset this, this is probably not an issue.
