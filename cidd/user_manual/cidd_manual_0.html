<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=4> Part I:  Using CIDD </FONT></I></B></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>1.0 Introduction to CIDD</FONT></B></P>
<H1>1.1.  What Is CIDD<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></SUP>? </H1>
<P>CIDD software was developed for displaying real-time gridded data in
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) field research projects.  This
program has been used for forecasting experiments for thunderstorms, hail, and
icing; aviation weather product verification; and coordination of research
aircraft and vehicles. It has been used for displaying real-time data from
radars, models, surface analysis, satellite imagery, and tracking algorithms. 
</P>
<H1>1.2.  What Does CIDD DO?</H1>
<P>CIDD's display capabilities include PPI/plan views, RHI/cross sections, and
CAPPI (see Section 3.2). Both RHI scans and reconstructed RHI from volume
scans can be displayed.</P>
<P>In addition to real-time display, the software provides archival data
access and movie looping capability.  It also provides extensive overlay
display capabilities, including geographic maps (state and county borders,
roads, terrain), wind vector sets, icons (radars, PAM stations, airports,
airplanes, vehicles), and real-time weather alerts or symbolic products (gust
fronts, station plots, microbursts, storm tracking, precipitation, weather
forecasting). </P>
<P>CIDD provides a simple graphic editing tool, allowing the user to draw
features over the data display and export them on a network for analysis and
forecasting. </P>
<H1>1.3.  Key Features of the Program</H1>
<P>An arbitrary number of fields can be accessed and the user can quickly
switch between the displayed fields. The user can zoom in to preset domains in
an arbitrary sub-area in both real-time and movie displays (see Section 6.0). 
</P>
<P>Other features include:  </P>
<P><FONT FACE="symbol">&#183;</FONT>  Ability to layer multiple grids together
onto each image. </P>
<P><FONT FACE="symbol">&#183;</FONT>  Modular, distributed design
client-server for accessing data. </P>
<P><FONT FACE="symbol">&#183;</FONT>  Flexible interface design allows CIDD to
be easily adapted to different project needs and weather product environment. 
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="symbol">&#183;</FONT>  CIDD allows point and click reading of
field values and locations.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="symbol">&#183;</FONT>  CIDD can be set up to operate in a
simplified, pre-configured mode for non-meteorologist use. </P>
<P><FONT FACE="symbol">&#183;</FONT>  CIDD provides a shared-memory interface
to auxillary programs, allowing specialized applications to be integrated with
the main display. </P>
<P><FONT FACE="symbol">&#183;</FONT>  CIDD  has a highly configurable design.
It can be set up to behave primarily as a real-time display or as an archival
data analysis display. </P>
<P><FONT FACE="symbol">&#183;</FONT>  The display can gather and integrate
data from geographically distant sights via internet connections. </P>
<H1>1.4.  Limitations</H1>
<P>CIDD is an X-windows-based display requiring a local X-server supporting at
least 256 colors.  </P>
<H1>1.5.  Who should Use CIDD?</H1>
<P>Radar operators can use CIDD for monitoring radar operations and product
generation. Research meteorologists can use CIDD for examining real-time or
archived radar data, weather product validation, coordinating field airplanes
and vehicles, and forecast experiments.</P>
<P>Operational meteorologists can use CIDD for weather monitoring, operational
forecasting, situation display, and product verification. End-users can use
CIDD to display pre-configured weather-related products. </P>
<H1>1.6.  The Parts of the User Manual </H1>
<P>The <I>CIDD User Manual</I> explains how to use, install, and customize
CIDD. Part I of the <I>User Manual</I> gives instructions for anyone who
intends to use CIDD. The program has many features and not all of them will be
apparent without reading Part I of the manual. </P>
<P>Part I of the manual starts with a brief review of mouse functions. It
assumes that the user has some experience using a mouse. The next section
explains the functions accessible from the Main Control panel of CIDD and the
pop-up panels. </P>
<P>The following chapters explain all functions of the program in detail. Part
I is the only part of the manual that the typical CIDD user needs to read. 
</P>
<P>Part II of the <I>User Manual</I> explains how to install and set up the
program. Only people who install the program or want to add new data sources
need to read this part of the manual. </P>
<P>The Installation Section consists of steps that an experienced Unix user
can perform and one step, <I>Writing a Server</I>, requires C programming
experience. </P>
<P>Part III of the <I>User Manual</I> consists of appendices that describe
each of the parameters used to customize CIDD. Customization involves
modifying text configuration files.  </P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>2.0 Getting Started </FONT></B></P>
<H1>2.1.  Review of Mouse Functions </H1>
<P>This section briefly reviews mouse actions for working with an X-window
application. It is assumed that the user is familiar with the X-window system,
so does not go into great detail. </P>
<P>If the user is instructed to click on a selection, s/he positions the
pointer over the selection and presses and releases the left button on the
mouse. The left button is used for most actions; if the user needs to press a
different button, the instructions will indicate which button is needed. 
</P>
<P>The main CIDD window's size and position on the screen is controlled
through standard X-window manager controls.  See your window manager
documentation. </P>
<P>If the user is instructed to drag an object, move the pointer over the
object, press the button when the mouse is positioned over the object,
continue to hold the button while moving the object and release the button
when the object is correctly positioned. </P>
<P>If instructions indicate that a left click is needed, position the mouse
and then press and release the left mouse button. </P>
<P><B>In review:</B></P>
<P>LEFT<B>    =   </B><I>select - use to select buttons, text, zoom or report
data values</I></P>
<P>MID<B>     =   </B><I>move/adjust - moves image display area</I></P>
<P>RIGHT<B>  =   </B><I>menu or select a vertical cross section </I></P>
<P></P>
<H2>2.1.1  Quitting the Program</H2>
<P>Select Quit from the window manager controls. </P>
<H1>2.2.  Regions of the CIDD Screen</H1>
<P>The main CIDD screen consists of two regions.  Along the top is a control
panel which controls movie looping and the display of the auxillary control
panels.  Below is the imaging area for data.  Another region is the thin
border line around the display. Clicking the right mouse button on this border
displays the window's menu; this feature is window manager dependent, however.
The menu offers the choice of closing the CIDD window (it becomes an icon) or
quitting from the program (also window manager dependent). </P>
<P><IMG SRC="cidd_manual.gif" ALT="cidd_manual.gif"></P>
<P></P>
<P>2.2.1 An example of the CIDD full screen display window. </P>
<H1>2.3.  The Main Control Panel </H1>
<P>The Main Control Panel contains buttons to control what is displayed. The
first of these is the <I>loop</I> button.  A window containing information
about the radar, such as altitude, beam width, longitude, and latitude appears
in the display area. </P>
<P>The radar button is a toggle, meaning that by clicking once, the Radar Data
window appears and clicking a second time makes the window disappear.</P>
<H2>2.3.1  Data Field Choices</H2>
<P>The next group of choices is the data field selections, i.e., reflectivity,
velocity, and signal-to-noise ratio. The number of fields that can be
displayed is customizable and dependent on the capabilities of the radar. To
select one of the fields, move the mouse so the pointer is over the button and
left click the mouse. This action de-selects whatever other field had
previously selected. </P>
<P>As a shortcut, keep the pointer in the display area and click the middle
mouse button. This action toggles back and forth between the two most recently
selected fields. </P>
<H2>2.3.2  Vertical Cross Section Display</H2>
<P>The next button of the control panel is the Vertical display button. RHI
gives a vertical cross section display along an arbitrary line.  </P>
<P><IMG SRC="cidd_manual1.gif" ALT="cidd_manual1.gif"></P>
<P> </P>
<P>2.3.3 Example, vertical cross section display window. </P>
<P>A display with range on the horizontal axis and height on the vertical axis
is placed on the screen. Fields are selected independently from the plan view
window, using the menu (right) button. To remove the display, left click the
vertical button a second time. Details about using the control window can be
found in ``Using Vertical Cross Section'' in this manual (see Section 5.0). 
</P>
<H2>2.3.4  CAPPI (vs RHI)<SUP>2</SUP> Display </H2>
<P>CIDD is capable of displaying constant altitude PPI and surface and
satellite imagery.  CIDD shows the data in its native state.  In order to
determine the type of plan view needed, look at the units next to the height
slider.  </P>
<H2>2.3.5  Zoom Capability</H2>
<P>CIDD has preset zooms. The user can click and drag on ``custom'' zoom
preset by using the left button.  Unzoom by picking one of the predefined
domains. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="cidd_manual2.gif" ALT="cidd_manual2.gif"></P>
<P> </P>
<P>2.3.6 Example, defining the area to zoom. </P>
<P>CIDD will preserve its aspect ratio by adjusting the zoom area to fit the
window.  </P>
<H2>2.3.7  Information Display</H2>
<P> </P>
<H2>2.3.8  More Controls</H2>
<P>The next control in the Main Control Panel is a slider for adjusting the
brightness of the displayed radar data. To use the slider, drag the slider by
holding down the left mouse button. To dim the display, move the slider to the
left. The primary purpose of dimming the display is to make overlays more
easily visible. </P>
<P>Clicking the Overlay button creates a window which displays various overlay
choices to be placed over the radar display area. The overlays may include
roads, other maps, grids, or weather products. At the left of the window are
categories of overlay and at the right are specific overlays. See Section 4.0,
``Using `PRDS' Product Selection'' for more information on this feature. 
</P>
<P>Clicking the Draw button on the Main Control panel displays options for
drawing. See Section 7.0, ``Using Draw'' for more information on this feature.
</P>
<P>The last button on the Main Control panel is the on-line help button.
Clicking this button (using the left mouse button) displays a window
containing basic instructions from this manual. A slider bar at the left of
the window lets you scroll quickly through the information to find answers to
your questions. To move quickly to a particular point, drag the slider up or
down using the mouse. To move backward or forward one page at a time, click on
the bar either above or below the slider. </P>
<H2>2.3.9  Reading Values</H2>
<P>An additional feature of the main display area and the cross section
display is the ability to obtain numeric values for a point. To do this, move
the mouse so that the pointer points to the location for the reading desired.
Click the left button on the mouse. A readout of numerical values appears on
the top of the display area. The readout includes the latitude and longitude
data value for the field (reflectivity, velocity, etc.) being displayed.  This
data is written to its shared memory area for auxillary programs to use.  For
example, a satellite image registration tool was built using this interface.

<P>To use overlays, click on the Overlay button in the Main Control panel. A
menu window will pop up displaying the symbolic product (alerts) selections. 
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="cidd_manual3.gif" ALT="cidd_manual3.gif"></P>
<P></P>
<P>4.1. Example of overlay menu window. </P>
<H1>4.2.  Products </H1>
<P>The menu window contains three separate lists. The list at the far left is
a listing of overlay classes. Some examples of classes include maps,
microburst products, and tornado products. Each of these may contain a number
of objects. The objects in a class are listed in the middle list. Examples of
objects in the Map class are a road map, a county map, or a rectangular grid.
Objects in a product class have a different naming convention, e.g., they have
a short text name followed by the time that the product originated. </P>
<P>Objects may have a further subdivision in the third list. For weather
products, the third list may have a time sequence tracking a particular
prediction. For example, if the class is microburst products, and the object
is a particular microburst prediction, the third list may have a time sequence
tracking the microburst. The third list is also used more generally for
providing a third level of subdivision.</P>
<P>Objects often have no third level list. For example, a county map in the
class Maps would not usually have any subdivision in the third list. </P>
<H1>4.3.  Using the Product Menu</H1>
<P>To use the overlay menu, first choose a class of overlays from the left
list. Items in the left list have a face symbol to the left, a name in the
center, and end with a number. A smiling face symbol indicates that overlays
in that class are available, and a frown indicates that overlays in that class
are not available (the product source has been turned off). The number
indicates how many objects are available in that class. To select a class,
click at the left of the overlay name, near the face symbol. To obtain a
sublist of objects in the class, click at the right side of the class name,
over the number, using the mouse button. </P>
<P>To choose an object, use the same procedure. Click at the left side of the
object name for object selection. To view a sublist for the object, click near
the right side of the name. </P>
<P>To choose an item within an object, obtain the list of items by clicking at
the right of the object name. Select the item or items by clicking on the
names of the items. </P>
<P>An object must be selected (the object name is highlighted) for all 2 or 3
levels before the object will be displayed over the radar data area as an
overlay. CIDD can support as many overlays, simultaneously, as the user wishes
to use. </P>
<P>By clicking on the Cut button, objects or subitems of objects (but not
classes) can be removed easily. The pointer changes shape and any object or
subitem clicked on will permanently be removed from the database.  <I>There is
no way to restore an object once it has been cut.</I></P>
<P>The Loop button is currently not a supported function.</P>
<P>CIDD can be run without overlay capability if desired. The overlay function
is a separate process called ``prds'' that is independent of CIDD. The
functioning of the overlay program is controlled by a file called
``prds.conf''. Whether or not prds will be active depends upon whether it is
included in the cidd script file. CIDD also works with <I>prod_sel</I>.

<P>If Step is selected while in Time mode and the user clicks on the bar to
the right of the Frame slider, the next frame at the specified tilt will be
displayed. Clicking on the bar to the left of the Frame slider will jump back
one frame in time. The A (All) and V (Volume) buttons also affect display of
data in both Auto and Step. By Clicking on A, all frames at the specified
elevation, including repeats of an elevation in a volume, are displayed. By
clicking on V, only one frame per volume is displayed. </P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>7.0 Using Draw - ``Expt''-  The Exporter</FONT></B>
</P>
<P>CIDD supports a screen drawing capability. This capability can be used to
draw weather products or other graphic overlays. CIDD is also capable of
exporting the weather products drawn in CIDD to other programs. CIDD can also
receive weather products from itself for addition to its product overlay database.
</P>
<P>Knowledge of the drawing methods is not needed for learning other functions
of CIDD. Since the use of the drawing function is for limited purposes,
reading this section is optional. </P>
<H1>7.1.  The Draw Menus</H1>
<P>To use the drawing capability, move the mouse so that the pointer is over
the Draw button in the Main Control panel and left click the mouse. A pop-up
menu is displayed in the data display area. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="cidd_manual6.gif" ALT="cidd_manual6.gif"></P>
<P></P>
<P>7.1.1 Example, of the Draw pop-up menu.</P>
<P>The pop-up menu has four buttons: New, Copy, Export, and Cut. The menu also
has a list box which shows the names of drawings as they are created. When
Draw is first selected, the box is empty (no drawings have been created yet).
To start, click on New using the left mouse button. A second menu is
displayed. This menu has choices for type of object. For example, in the
diagram there are choices of Nowcast, Boundary, and Rotation among the six
choices. On the menu there is also a set of choices for choosing the initial
shape of an object. Choices for initial shape are a circle, a rectangle, a
line, and a sym (symbol), and an unrelated choice of mdf (modify). </P>
<P>Click on one of the choices for object type. Then click on a choice for
initial shape. Move the pointer into the radar data display area and click the
right (not left) button. A shape appears near the pointer. Next to the shape
is a square control box.</P>
<H1>7.2.  Using the Control Box</H1>
<P>Each shape that is created has a square control box nearby. The square
control box is composed of four small squares each holding a symbol. The four
squares provide four different functions. </P>
<P></P>
<P>7.2.1 Example of an active drawing with its control box. </P>
<P><B>Note:</B> To use these functions, and for other drawing tasks, use the
right mouse button, not the left button as is done for most other actions.
Continue to use the left button in the pop-up menus. </P>
<P>To move an object, move the pointer onto the upper left square in the
control box. Press and hold the right mouse button and drag the control box,
tied to the drawing, to its new location and release the mouse button. 
</P>
<P>To change the size of a drawing, use the square at the lower left of the
control box, marked with a +/- symbol. Move the pointer onto this square,
press the right mouse button, and drag the control box toward the drawing to
decrease its size, or away from the drawing to increase its size. Release the
mouse button when the drawing is the correct size. </P>
<P><B>Note:</B> For a symbol, changing the size or location are the only
changes possible. Changing the points or shape is not possible. </P>
<P>If a line is chosen as the initial shape, the user can add line segments by
moving the pointer to new locations and clicking the right mouse button. If
the user wants to terminate one set of line segments and start a new line,
click on the square at the lower right of the control box, marked with an X.
The next point clicked on will not be attached to the previous segments.
</P>
<P>When drawing line segments, instead of clicking the mouse, press the mouse
button and drag the point to its final location. By dragging the point close
to the end point of another segment, the two end points will join and the line
segments will form a closed shape. </P>
<P>Use the termination square, the upper right square of the control box, to
terminate drawing. This action may automatically select Export, as if selected
from the first pop-up menu. The configuration file for drawing, <I>exprt.conf
</I>, determines whether termination automatically selects export. Using
Export is explained further below. </P>
<H1>7.3.  More Draw Features</H1>
<P>For any shape except a symbol, move the pointer near to a point in the
shape and press the right mouse button. This action grabs the point, splitting
the line into two segments on each side of the point. It is possible to drag
the point and attach line segments to a new location. </P>
<P>After creating a circle or rectangle, it is possible to modify these
objects. Move the pointer into the data display area and press and hold the
right button instead of clicking it. For a rectangle, drag the mouse near the
marked corner and drag the corner to change the shape and size. For a circle,
drag the mouse to change the size of the circle. </P>
<P>By selecting ``New'' several times you will have several separate drawings
on the display. The drawings are listed in the pop-up menu. Only one drawing
is active at any time. The active drawing has the control box located nearby.
The active drawing is the only drawing that can be modified. </P>
<P>Drawings listed in the pop-up menu are identified by an abbreviation for
the type of object followed by the data time. The data time is the time
displayed for the data when the object is drawn.</P>
<P>By clicking on the left part of the drawing name in the list box, you make
the drawing active. Clicking over the letter ``S'' at the right of the name
toggles the drawing between being invisible and visible. </P>
<P>By selecting ``Cut'' from the pop-up menu, the active drawing is erased. 
<I>There is no way to restore a drawing once it has been cut. </I></P>
<H1>7.4.  Using Copy</H1>
<P>By selecting ``Copy'' from the pop-up menu, the secondary pop-up menu
appears. There are two types of copy to choose from; one type copies only the
name of the active drawing and the other type copies the shape but not the
name. </P>
<P>To copy the shape, select the type of object from the secondary pop-up menu
and from the same menu, select mdf (modify). The active shape is copied. The
copy is difficult to see because it is placed on top of the original. To move
the copy, move the pointer onto the upper left square of the control box and
drag the copy to a new location.</P>
<P>To copy the name only, don't change the object type. Select an initial
shape. Move the pointer into the data display area and click the right mouse
button. A new shape appears with the name copied from the last active drawing. 
</P>
<H1>7.5.  Using Export</H1>
<P>To export a drawing from CIDD, select the Export button. The exported
drawing can be imported for use in other programs or it can be imported back
into CIDD to be added to the overlay database.</P>
<P>Selecting export causes a pop-up window for Export to be displayed. (If the
configuration file specified that the type of object is not exportable, an
error message is displayed.) The pop-up window shows the issue time of the
drawing and a default valid time. If the configuration file permits, select a
different length of time that the object is valid. The valid time is not used
within CIDD. </P>
<P>The pop-up window allows space for entering a comment. The comment is part
of the data exported with the drawing. </P>
<P>When all changes have been completed to user changeable fields, click on
Export to export the overlay from CIDD. Exports must be imported by CIDD or
other programs to be of any use. See Section _____ ``Files for Programming'',
later in this manual for information about writing a program to import
drawings for use in other programs. </P>
<H1>7.6.  Exporting Back to CIDD</H1>
<P>It is possible to take drawings exported from CIDD and import them back for
use as overlays. This process does not require programming. To import drawings
back into CIDD, start the drawing program with the command: </P>
<P>exprt -oprds_in_pope &amp;</P>
<P>(in the script file ``cidd'' to replace the command ``exprt &amp;''). Then
output from the Draw program is directed into the input of the overlay
program. </P>
