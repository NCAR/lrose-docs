<P>
Maps are stored as 'flat' ascii files.  They can be named however you
wish, although our convention is 'something_descriptive.map' CIDD can load
its maps via a HTTP server, so it is often convieneint to store everyone's
maps in <A HREF="http://www.rap.ucar.edu/maps"> a central place, </A>
served by a Web (HTTP) Server, to avoid duplication and obsolescence.
CIDD will search a comma delimited set of directories or URL's for maps.
Additionally, CIDD will also check the directory its parameter file is stored in
before looking in the other directories/(web sites) listed in the param file.
This makes a good place to put one-off or modified maps, while still
making use of the common map site for all other maps.


<P>
These are the allowable types of lines within a ASCII RAP MAP file:
<OL>
<LI> Comment lines, which have the character "#" in column 1
<LI> Keyword lines, begining with a keyword, followed by parameters,
such as the number of data points which follow or offsets for text.
<LI> Data Lines  - contain polyline or icon definition data
</OL>

<P>
<H2>Keyword lines: <font size=2> -
Note the MAP_NAME, TRANSFORM and PROJECTION lines are optional </font> </H2>

<UL>
<LI> <B>  MAP_NAME </B> name desc  (OPTIONAL) <BR>
   This should be the first line of any map file. The name is restricted to
64 characters, and must not have whitespace in it. The description is restricted
to 64 chars.  A list of available map names (and desc) may be passed to client
programs; typically it is displayed for the user to select from. CIDD Does not use this
</LI>

<LI> <B>  TRANSFORM </B> tranformation_matrix (OPTIONAL) <BR>
Optional line used by digitizing program.   CIDD Does not use this
</LI>
   
<LI> <B>  PROJECTION </B> type parameters (OPTIONAL) <BR>
Optional line used by digitizing program. type = PJG_XXXX; see PJG.h for
description of the projection parameters. -Note CIDD Does not use this
</LI>
   
<LI> <B>  ICONDEF </B> icon_name npts <BR>
		x y <BR>
		x y <BR>
		x y <BR>
		... <BR>
This defines an icon with name 'icon_name'. It consists of npts number
of points, which immediately follow, one point per line.  The 'x y' are
in units of pixels, and the line '32767 32767' indicates a pen up. The
pen goes down at the next 'x y' point.  Note ICONDEF defines an icon,
but does not draw it. Use one or more ICON lines to have the Icon drawn
at the indicated lat, lon.
</LI>

<LI> <B>  ICON </B> icon_name lat lon text_x text_y text <BR>
This Keyword indicates the icon 'icon_name' should be drawn, with the
origin (0,0) at 'lat lon'.  If 'text_x text_y' is not equal to "32767
32767", then also draw the text 'text', with the lower left corner of
the text at 'text_x text_y' pixels relative to the origin.  An ICON line
must refer to an icon_name that is already defined by a ICONDEF in the
same map file.  An ICON stays the about same size as the user zooms.
</LI>

<LI> <B>  POLYLINE </B> name npts <BR>
	    lat lon <BR>
	    lat lon <BR>
	    ... <BR>
		-1000 -1000 <BR>
	    lat lon <BR>
	    lat lon <BR>
	    ... <BR>
This defines an object called 'name', which is simply a polyline of
npts segments, specified in world (lat, lon) coordinates. Penup =
-1000, -1000. The pen is place down at the next lat, lon point
</LI>

<LI> <B>  SIMPLELABEL </B> lat lon  text <BR>
	lat lon = lower left corner of the Text Location
	text =  text to display <BR>
</LI>
