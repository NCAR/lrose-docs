To report issues:
1. Navigate to the "Issues" section of the lrose-core Github  repository.  
2. Check the existing reports for related  issues to see if the bug has already been reported.
3. If there is an existing related issue,  add a comment to confirm you are also experiencing the problem, which helps maintainers prioritize.  
4. To create a new issue, make a clear, short, specific title that summarizes the issue.
5. Add a description when and how the issue occurred.  
6. Include steps to reproduce the bug as  a numbered list of precise, easy-to-follow steps.  
7. Try to include  what you expected to happen versus what actually occurred.  
8. Include  environment details like operating system, software version, browser (if web-based), and any other system specifics.  
9. Attach visual proof and logs such as screenshots,  or console output/logs if possible, as these can be invaluable for debugging. 
10. Try to include minimal sized input files, and output files needed to produce the error.
11. Finally,  follow up with an email to lrose-help, if you'd like.
