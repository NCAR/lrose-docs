<h3>Multiple TDRP classs in C++</h3>

Complicated applications may require more than one TDRP class,
although this is rare in practice. TDRP supports multiple classes.<p>

Suppose you need two classes, Class1 and Class2. You would then create two
paramdef files, say paramdef.Class1 and paramdef.Class2. The <a
href="Makefiles.html">Makefile</a> can easily be set up to generate
two code classes.<p>

The following files would be generated:<p>
<pre>
  Class1.hh
  Class1.cc
  Class2.hh
  Class2.cc
</pre>

Each class has its own user interface. Instead of
using <tt>_tdrp_load_from_args()</tt>, you would use the functions:

<pre>
  Class1::load()
  Class2::load()
</pre>

to load up the parameters for each class.<p>

Since the load() functions operate at a lower level than
_load_from_args(), you will need to write code to parse the command
line and respond to any TDRP arguments.<p>
