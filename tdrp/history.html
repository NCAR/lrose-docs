<h3>TDRP history</h3>

<h4>1993</h4>

John Yunker created the RTP (Run-Time Parameters) system, consisting
of the rtp library and a program for generating code. rtp was based
on lex and yacc and created a number of table files which were 
needed by the running executable.

<h4>1994</h4>

John Caron reworked RTP into TDRP (Table-Driven Runtime Parameters).
TDRP was still based on lex and yacc. tdrp_gen generated 3 header files
and 1 C-code file. The run-time tables were no longer required.

<h4>1995 - 1997</h4>

Mike Dixon ported TDRP to Dec Alpha and Linux, fixing some memory bugs
along the way. The number of generated files was reduced from 4 to 2,
one header and one C code. The Slackware Linux port was
straightfoward. However, later Linux versions used bison for yacc, and
tdrp_gen exhibited a bug which we have never been able to solve.
Therefore the Slackware yacc and lex programs had to be installed
for TDRP to work.

<h4>1998</h4>

Mike Dixon rewrote TDRP in vanilla C to remove the dependency on
yacc and lex which was causing problems on Linux. The system was
enhanced in a number of ways, and C++ class code generation was
added.
