    "Radar data, by default, is stored in a **polar (or antenna) coordinate system**, with the data coordinates stored as an angle (ranging from 0 to 360 degrees with 0 == North), and a radius from the radar, and an elevation which is the angle between the ground and the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "This format can be challenging to plot, since it is scan/radar specific. Also, it can make comparing with model data, which is on a lat/lon grid, challenging since one would need to **transform** the model daa cartesian coordinates to polar/antenna coordiantes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, PyART has a variety of gridding routines, which can be used to **grid your data to a Cartesian grid**. Once it is in this new grid, one can easily slice/dice the dataset, and compare to other data sources.\n",

    "### Why is Gridding Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gridding is essential to combining multiple data sources (ex. multiple radars), and comparing to other data sources (ex. model data). There are also decisions that are made during the gridding process that have a large impact on the regridded data - for example:\n",
