LIDAR RADAR Open Software Environment - LROSE

LROSE is a set of software tools for editing, analyzing, and visualizing LIDAR and RADAR 
data.  LROSE handles data in a variety of formats.  
LROSE tools can be used independently or in sequence.    


LROSE is a joint project between the Atmospheric Science Department at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Earth Observing 
Laboratory (EOL) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). 
In 2016, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded LROSE for four years.

LROSE development falls into six major phases:
1.  Data Conversion
2. Displays (Visualization)
3. Quality Control 
4.  Grid
5.  Echo
6.  Wind

The current, active phase of development is Data Conversion using RadxConvert.  A docker image of Soloii,
a data visualization tool, has already complete.
