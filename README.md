# LROSE - Lidar Radar Open Software Environment

LROSE is a set of tools to edit, analyze, and visualize LIDAR and RADAR 
data.  LROSE handles data from a variety of formats (netCDF, HDF5, BUFR, Cfarr, etc.).  
LROSE tools can be used independently or in sequence.    
  
## [History](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/lidar-radar-open-software-environment)

LROSE is a joint project between the Atmospheric Science Department at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Earth Observing 
Laboratory (EOL) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). 
In 2016, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded LROSE for four years.

 
## [Development Plan](docs/plan_draft.md)

LROSE development has six major phases:
1. Data Conversion
2. Visualization
3. Quality Control 
4. Grid
5. Echo
6. Wind

 Data Conversion using RadxConvert is the current phase of development.
